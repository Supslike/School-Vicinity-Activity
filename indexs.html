                        <p>Hello, I am Renzmel L. Monis, and I am one of the chosen tabulators for the recent intrams that happened in the school. I chose this photo as this is one of my remarkable moments in my life. This gave me a deeper understanding of working behind the scenes in events or big gatherings. This is just a short description of me, redirect to my personal web for more description</p>

                <h2>U.N INSIGHTS</h2>
                <p>The United Nations is pivotal for global cooperation, peace, and addressing challenges. Founded on principles of diplomacy and human rights, it strives for a fair world. Despite successes in aid, peacekeeping, and Sustainable Development Goals, challenges like bureaucracy persist. Nevertheless, the UN remains a vital forum for international collaboration, requiring ongoing reform to stay relevant in a changing world.</p>
                <p> Making a website about the UN, gave me a insight about how U.N plays a crucial role in our life, it allowed me to explore different aspects of topics regarding the UN.</p>
